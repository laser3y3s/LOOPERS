Code for detecting available free spaces in a car parking area.

Originally presented at Ideathon

Programming Language: Python 3
Library used: OpenCV

Detecting car parking spaces using image_processing/Computer_Vision and displaying the count value onto a smartphone application GUI.
For any given parking space the system can make use of the existing CCTV camera(s) and use it's live video feed and apply image processing techniques and thus finally being able to detect how many number of free spaces are avialable for use and then simply showing this count value onto either a webpage or on a dedicated smartphone application. 
ALL done in real time.
